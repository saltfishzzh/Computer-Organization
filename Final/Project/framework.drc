WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXI_21/Cpu_data4bus<0>3 is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXI_30/XLXN_11<0> is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
